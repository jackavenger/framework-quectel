19.Fixed the bug that ADC sampling is not accurate.
20.Optimized timer interfaces Ql_StartTimer/Ql_StopTimer/Ql_DeleteTimer which can be called in different tasks.

OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.4   
June 26  2019
1.Added the GPIO pins (GPIO0, USB_MODE, GPIO6~GPIO8).
2.Added timer API for microsecond counting.
3.Added Ql_Timer_Delete API to delete current timer ID.
4.Added Ql_Delay_us API to microsecond delay.
5.Added Ql_UART_GetOption API to query UART parameters.
6.Added Ql_OS_GetCurrenTaskLeftStackSize API for querying remaining stack size for dedicated task.
7.Added Ql_UART_GetOption API to query UART parameters.
8.Added Ql_ADC_Read API to single read ADC values.
9.Fixed the bug that UART will be stuck when receive 1400 more bytes in one time.
10.Fixed the bug that the time reading result is wrong when set a time-zone not equal to 32 using Ql_SetLocalTime API.
11.Update the return value of event and mutex interfaces.
12.Update Functional Documents and AT Documents.
13.Added Ql_OS_GetTaskTickCount and Ql_OS_GetTaskTickCountFromISR API to count of ticks.
14.Update the example and RIL API of lwm2m.
15.Added  the example and RIL API of MQTT.
16.Added Ql_Mqtt_Recv_Register¡¢Ql_Lwm2m_Write_Req_Register¡¢Ql_Socket_Recv_Register to recv Downlink data.

OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.3
March 10  2019
1.Update Functional Documents and AT Documents.
2.Unrestricted the time interval limitation of ADC sampling. The minimum time interval can be configured as 10ms.
3.Modified the implementation of Ql_OS_GetMessage for dedicated scenarios â€ADC/Normal EINT/Normal TIMER. This function will
not return after the callback is called. It will go to the message receive code again internally to fetch the next message.
4.Fixed the bug that some GPIOs will hop during power on phase.
5.Update the RTC¡¢LWM2M and onenet example.
6.Fixed the bug that json data cannot be receive in onenet.
7.Supported upgrade APP bin file via DFOTA. 

OpenCPU_NB1_SDK_V1.2
Nov 20  2018

2.Fixed the bug that change the RIL interface of network protocol to solve the problem of memory leakage.
3.Optimized the behavior to obtain receiving format in TCP/UDP.
4.Fixed the bug that the module will crash when frequent using AT+QRST.
5.Fixed the bug that -4(RIL_AT_INVALID_PARAM)is returned when calling Ql_RIL_SendATCmd() to send non AT commands.
6.Modified the buffer length of the RIL interface to 1400 bytes.
